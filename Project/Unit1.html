  <h1 id="unit-1-an-introduction-to-differential-equations">Unit 1 – An
    Introduction to Differential Equations</h1>
  <h2 id="basic-terminology">Basic Terminology</h2>
  <h4 id="differential-equations">Differential equations</h4>
  <p>Equations that include derivatives of unknown functions – often used
    for modeling applications</p>
  <p>Example: <span class="math inline">\(5x^2y&#39;+2xy = 0\)</span></p>
  <h4 id="ordinary-differential-equations-odes">Ordinary Differential
    Equations (ODEs)</h4>
  <p>Differential equations where there is only one independent
    variable</p>
  <p>Example: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} +
      4\frac{dy}{dt} = 2\)</span></p>
  <h4 id="partial-differential-equations-pdes">Partial Differential
    Equations (PDEs)</h4>
  <p>Differential equations containing partial derivatives of a function
    and there are at least two independent variables</p>
  <p>Example: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} =
      2\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2}\)</span></p>
  <h4 id="the-order-of-a-differential-equation">The Order of a
    Differential Equation</h4>
  <p>The order of a differential equation is equal to the order of the
    highest derivative</p>
  <p>Example: The order of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} +
      4\frac{dy}{dt} = 2\)</span> is 2 because the highest derivative is a
    second derivative</p>
  <h4 id="normal-form">Normal Form</h4>
  <p>An <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th order ODE can be written
    as:</p>
  <p><span class="math display">\[F(x,y,\frac{dy}{dx},\frac{d^2y}{dx^2},\dots,\frac{d^ny}{dx^n})=0\]</span></p>
  <p>If the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th derivative is
    continuous and real, then it can be written in normal form:</p>
  <p><span
      class="math display">\[\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}=F(x,y,\frac{dy}{dx},\frac{d^2y}{dx^2},\dots,\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}})\]</span>
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <h2 id="solutions-to-differential-equations">Solutions to Differential
    Equations</h2>
  <p>A solution <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> to a
    differential equation has derivatives that are continuous on some
    interval, for which <span class="math inline">\(F(x, \phi,
      \phi&#39;,\dots,\phi^{(n)})=0\)</span> within the interval.</p>
  <p>Some solutions belong to a <em>solution family</em> where one or more
    constants can vary and still satisfy the differential equation</p>
  <p>If a solution doesn’t belong to a family, then it is a <em>singular
      solution</em></p>
  <p>If <span class="math inline">\(y=0\)</span> is a solution, it is
    often called a <em>trivial solution</em></p>
  <p>Solutions are defined on an <strong>interval of definition</strong>,
    which contains the values of the independent variable for which the
    solution is defined. For example, if an ODE had a solution <span class="math inline">\(y = 1/\sqrt{x}\)</span>, then
    the interval of
    definition would be <span class="math inline">\(x \in
      (0,\infty)\)</span> because that is where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is defined.</p>
  <h5 id="explicit-solutions">Explicit Solutions</h5>
  <p>Explicit solutions contain only the dependent variable</p>
  <p>Example: <span class="math inline">\(y = x^2+x\)</span></p>
  <h5 id="implicit-solutions">Implicit Solutions</h5>
  <p>Implicit solutions cannot be written solely in terms of the dependent
    variable</p>
  <p>Example: <span class="math inline">\(y^3+y^2=x^4+3x+C\)</span></p>
  <h4 id="linearity">Linearity</h4>
  <p>An ODE is linear if all its coefficients of derivatives are only
    functions of the independent variable</p>
  <p>Linear example: <span class="math inline">\(3xy&#39;+xy = \ln
      x\)</span></p>
  <p>Non-linear example: <span class="math inline">\(y\tan y + e^y =
      x^2\)</span></p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <h2 id="initial-value-problems-ivps">Initial Value Problems (IVPs)</h2>
  <p>An <em>IVP</em> is a differential equation with order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> with specified values
    of the unknown
    function and its derivatives up to <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> at a certain point. The purpose of an
    IVP is to obtain a specific solution to the differential equation.
    Solutions do not need to be unique.</p>
  <h3 id="existence-and-uniqueness-theorem">Existence and Uniqueness
    Theorem</h3>
  <p>For an IVP, if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (the function
    in normal form) and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial
      f}{\partial y}\)</span> (its partial derivative with respect to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>) are
    <em>both</em> continuous in some
    rectangle around the initial value <span class="math inline">\((x_0,
      y_0)\)</span>, then there must exist a <em>unique</em> solution to the
    IVP on some interval within that rectangle.</p>
  <p>If <em>only <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span></em> is continuous
    in the rectangle, then a solution is <em>guaranteed to exist</em> within
    the interval, but is <em>not guaranteed to be unique</em>.</p>
  <p>If <em>neither</em> <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> nor <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial
      f}{\partial y}\)</span> are
    continuous in the rectangle, then a unique solution <em>could exist</em>
    but is <em>not guaranteed to exist</em> by the theorem.</p>
  <p>Example: <span class="math inline">\(y&#39; = y^{1/2},
      y(1)=1\)</span></p>
  <p>At the point <span class="math inline">\((1,1)\)</span> both <span class="math inline">\(y&#39; = y^{1/2}\)</span>
    and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial y&#39;}{\partial y} =
      \frac{1}{2y^{1/2}}\)</span> are continuous, so there exists a unique
    solution for this IVP on some interval around <span class="math inline">\((1,1)\)</span>.</p>
  <p>If instead the initial point was <span class="math inline">\((0,0)\)</span>, then <span
      class="math inline">\(y&#39;\)</span> would be continuous but <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial
      y&#39;}{\partial y}\)</span> would
    not because there would be a division by <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. This means that a solution exists
    at
    <span class="math inline">\((0,0)\)</span> but it is not guaranteed to
    be unique.</p>
