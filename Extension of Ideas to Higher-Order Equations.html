<h1 id="extension-of-ideas-to-higher-order-equations">Extension of Ideas to Higher-Order Equations</h1>
<p>In a previous section, <a href="homogeneous second-order equations with constant coefficients.html#">homogeneous second-order equations with constant coefficients</a> were discussed. Homogeneous equations with constant coefficients of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th order more generally take the form: <span class="math display">\[c_ny^{(n)} + c_{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + c_1y&#39;+c_0y=0\]</span>
The solution technique for higher order equations of this form is the same as in the second order case. For example, for a third order equation <span class="math inline">\(ay&#39;&#39;&#39;+by&#39;&#39;+cy&#39;+dy=0\)</span>, plugging in the solution form <span class="math inline">\(y=e^{mx}\)</span> results in <span class="math inline">\(e^{mx}(am^3+bm^2+cm+d)=0\)</span>. In this case, the <em>auxiliary equation</em> is: <span class="math display">\[am^3+bm^2+cm+d=0\]</span>
Since this is a third degree polynomial, there will be three linearly independent solutions. Generally, for an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th order homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients, there will be <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> linearly independent solutions. If all the solutions are unique and real, then the solutions will generally take the form: <span class="math display">\[y=c_1e^{m_1x}+c_2e^{m_2x} + \cdots c_ne^{m_nx}\]</span>
Fortunately, solutions to higher order equations follow the same pattern as 2nd order equations. The same pattern is also followed if there are repeated roots. Simply make sure that each repeated term as an increasing degree of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> multiplied by it to make sure the solutions are linearly independent.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Example</strong>: solve <span class="math inline">\(y&#39;&#39;&#39;+3y&#39;&#39;+3y&#39;+y=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The auxiliary equation is <span class="math inline">\(m^3+3m^2+3m+1=0\)</span>. This simplifies to: <span class="math inline">\((m+1)^3=0 \to m=-1\)</span>. This is a triple root, so the general solution is written as <span class="math inline">\(y=c_1e^{-x}+c_2xe^{-x}+c_3x^2e^{-x}\)</span>. If this was a quadruple root, the fourth solution would take the form <span class="math inline">\(c_4x^3e^{-x}\)</span>, and this pattern continues for higher order equations.</p>
<hr />
<p>At equations of order 4 or higher, it is possible to get <em>double (and greater multiplicity) pairs of complex roots</em>. Fortunately, the same pattern discussed above can be used in these cases. Multiply an <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> onto the second <span class="math inline">\(\cos\beta x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sin\beta x\)</span> terms to create the second two linearly independent solutions: for <span class="math inline">\(m=\alpha\pm\beta i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y=c_1e^{\alpha x}\cos\beta x + c_2e^{\alpha x}\sin\beta x + c_3xe^{\alpha x}\cos\beta x + c_4xe^{\alpha x}\sin\beta x\)</span>. If a solution somehow results in a triple or higher complex root, add <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> terms of increasing degree to each successive term, like with real roots of higher multiplicity.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Example</strong>: solve <span class="math inline">\(y^{(4)}+2y&#39;&#39;+y=0\)</span></p>
<p>The auxiliary equation is <span class="math inline">\(m^4+2m^2+1=0\)</span>. This factors to <span class="math inline">\((m^2+1)^2=0\)</span>, so there is a double complex root of <span class="math inline">\(m=0\pm i\)</span>. The solution is written: <span class="math inline">\(y=c_1\cos x+c_2\sin x + c_3x\cos x+c_4x\sin x\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you want, you can try using <a href="Linear Operators and Linear Independence.html#the-wronskian">the Wronskian</a> to show that all the solution functions are linearly independent.</p>
