# MATH2410Q â€“ Differential Equations Final Project

This repository contains all the files I used for my final project in MATH 2410Q Differential Equations at the University of Connecticut. This website serves as a summary of the content of this course. The goal is for anyone with basic knowledge in calculus to be able to read these pages and gain an understanding of differential equations.

Originally, these files were markdown files hosted using [obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). Here, I have converted these files to html to host them using github pages.


## Issues
If you notice any errors in the website, feel free to submit an issue on github. I'll get to it eventually, probably.
